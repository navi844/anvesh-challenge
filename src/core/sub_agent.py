"""
A delegated sub-agent call — the main investigation loop (agent_loop.py)
hands off to this one once it has gathered evidence, asking it to draft a
formal SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) narrative for a human reviewer.

This is a SEPARATE model call with its OWN system prompt and its own
conversation history — not a continuation of the main loop's messages
list. That separateness is exactly what makes incident 3 possible: the
sub-agent only knows what it's explicitly told in its own prompt.
